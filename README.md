# Hi, I'm Edoardo Santucci ðŸ‘‹

[cite_start]I am a Master's student in **Communication Technologies and System Design** at DTU, specializing in **Cloud and CyberSecurity**[cite: 6, 7, 8]. [cite_start]Building on a background in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering[cite: 14], my primary focus now is on communication networks and cloud infrastructures. [cite_start]My academic projects have provided hands-on experience in cloud deployment, network security practices, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) [cite: 9, 17][cite_start], and IoT development[cite: 10].

I am driven by the challenge of solving complex technical problems and am actively seeking a Student Assistant position in Copenhagen where I can apply my skills in a real-world setting.
